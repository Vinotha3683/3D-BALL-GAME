 I delved into the fascinating world of Unity and created a dynamic Unity 3D ball game. ðŸ’»

<br />In this game, players navigate a rolling ball through a vibrant 3D environment using both WASD and arrow keys, adding an extra layer of control and immersion. The objective? Collect as many spinning cubes as possible while maneuvering through challenging obstacles.

<br />One of the highlights of this project was the implementation of scoring mechanics. With each cube collected, players earn points, creating an engaging gameplay loop that keeps them coming back for more.

<br />Here are some of the key elements I used to bring this game to life:

<br />ðŸ”¹ Unity 3D: Leveraging the powerful Unity engine allowed me to create stunning visuals and seamless gameplay mechanics.
<br />ðŸ”¹ C# Programming: Utilizing C# scripting, I programmed the game logic, player controls, scoring system, and more.
<br />ðŸ”¹ 3D Modeling: I designed and integrated 3D models for the ball, cubes, and environment, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.
<br />ðŸ”¹ Physics Engine: By leveraging Unity's built-in physics engine, I implemented realistic ball movement and collision interactions, adding depth to the gameplay experience.
